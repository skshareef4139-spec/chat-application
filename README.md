💬 Chat App

A clean and minimal chat application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Users can type messages and see them appear instantly in the chat window with a simple, responsive UI.

This project focuses on core front-end concepts like DOM manipulation and event handling, without using any backend or external libraries.
